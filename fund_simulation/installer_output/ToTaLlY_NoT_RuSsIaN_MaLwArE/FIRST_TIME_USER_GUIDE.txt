## Understanding Your Results

### Key Metrics Explained

#### MOIC (Multiple on Invested Capital)
- **What it is:** How many times your money multiplied
- **Example:** 2.5x means $1 invested ‚Üí $2.50 returned
- **1.0x** = break even
- **<1.0x** = loss
- **>1.0x** = profit

#### IRR (Internal Rate of Return)
- **What it is:** Annualized rate of return
- **Example:** 25% IRR means 25% per year
- **Compare to:** Public market returns (~10% historically)

#### Mean vs. Median
- **Mean:** Average of all simulations
- **Median:** Middle value (50th percentile)
- **If similar:** Distribution is symmetric
- **If different:** Distribution is skewed

#### Percentiles
- **5th Percentile:** Only 5% of scenarios were worse
- **95th Percentile:** Only 5% of scenarios were better
- **Range:** Shows best-case to worst-case outcomes

### Reading the Charts

#### Histograms
- **X-axis:** MOIC or IRR value
- **Y-axis:** Frequency (how often that outcome occurred)
- **Tall bars:** Common outcomes
- **Short bars:** Rare outcomes
- **Wider spread:** More uncertainty

**Red dashed line:** Mean (average)
**Green dashed line:** Median (middle value)

#### Beta Path Chart
- **Blue lines:** Individual market scenarios
- **Dark blue line:** Median path
- **Red dashed line:** 5th percentile (downside)
- **Green dashed line:** 95th percentile (upside)

### Interpreting Results

#### Healthy Results Typically Show:
- ‚úÖ Median MOIC > 1.5x (profitable)
- ‚úÖ Median IRR > 15% (exceeds public markets)
- ‚úÖ 5th percentile MOIC > 1.0x (low downside risk)
- ‚úÖ Narrow distribution (consistent performance)

#### Warning Signs:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Median MOIC < 1.2x (low returns)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è 5th percentile MOIC < 0.5x (high downside risk)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Very wide distribution (unpredictable)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è High negative scenarios (>20% of simulations losing money)

## Common Questions

### Q: How long does a simulation take?

**A:** Typically 10-30 seconds for 10,000 simulations. Factors:
- Number of simulations (more = slower)
- Number of historical investments (more = slower)
- Your computer speed

### Q: How many simulations should I run?

**A:**
- **1,000:** Quick testing, rough estimates
- **10,000:** Standard analysis (recommended)
- **100,000:** Very precise, publication-quality

**More simulations = more accurate results but takes longer**

### Q: What if I don't have beta price data?

**A:** You can still run simulations, but:
- Upload just your investment data
- Simulation will use historical returns directly
- You won't get alpha/beta decomposition
- Results will be simpler but still useful

5. End those processes
6. Launch application again

### Issue: Results look wrong / unexpected

**Checklist:**
1. ‚úÖ Did you upload the right CSV file?
2. ‚úÖ Is your data in the correct format?
3. ‚úÖ Are MOIC values realistic? (e.g., 2.5 not 250)
4. ‚úÖ Are IRR values as decimals? (e.g., 0.25 not 25)
5. ‚úÖ Did the simulation complete all 4 stages?

**Try:**
- Review Data Import tab - check preview table
- Re-run simulation with same settings
- Compare results to expected range

## Tips for Success

### Best Practices

‚úÖ **Start with test data** - Try 1,000 simulations first to verify settings
‚úÖ **Review your data** - Check the preview table after upload
‚úÖ **Save your settings** - Screenshot your configuration for reference
‚úÖ **Export immediately** - Download Excel results right after simulation
‚úÖ **Run multiple scenarios** - Try optimistic/base/pessimistic outlooks
‚úÖ **Compare results** - Run with different horizons or portfolio sizes

### Data Quality Matters

Your results are only as good as your input data:
- ‚úÖ Use actual historical returns (not estimates)
- ‚úÖ Include both winners and losers
- ‚úÖ Have at least 20+ historical investments
- ‚úÖ Ensure dates are accurate
- ‚úÖ Verify MOIC and IRR calculations

### Understanding Limitations

Monte Carlo simulation:
- ‚úÖ Shows possible outcomes and probabilities
- ‚úÖ Models historical patterns continuing
- ‚ùå Cannot predict black swan events
- ‚ùå Assumes past is representative of future
- ‚ùå Cannot account for strategy changes

**Use results to inform decisions, not make them automatically!**
