## 🚀 Quick Start - Building Your Installer

### For Developers (You)

**1. Install Inno Setup** (one-time):
```
Download: https://jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php
Install to default location
```

**2. Build the installer**:
```cmd
cd "C:\Users\ZacharyMatula\Code Projects\Private Fund Simulation\fund_simulation"
build_installer.bat
```

**3. Distribute**:
```
Share: installer_output\FundSimulation_Setup_v1.0.0.exe
```

That's it! The installer is ready for your team.

## 📊 What the Application Does

### Monte Carlo Fund Simulation
- Analyzes historical fund performance
- Separates alpha (manager skill) from beta (market returns)
- Projects future performance using statistical modeling
- Generates professional Excel reports

### 4-Stage Analysis
1. **Beta Decomposition**: Separates market effects from alpha
2. **Alpha Simulation**: Models manager skill component
3. **Beta Forward Simulation**: Projects future market scenarios
4. **Reconstruction**: Combines alpha and beta for total returns

### Key Outputs
- Executive summary
- Distribution charts (MOIC, IRR)
- Statistical analysis
- Professional Excel reports
- CSV data exports

## 🐛 Common Issues & Solutions

### Installation Issues

**"Python not detected"**
- Installer will prompt to download Python
- Click "Yes" to open Python download page
- Install Python 3.8 or higher
- Re-run installer

**"Installation failed"**
- Run as Administrator
- Disable antivirus temporarily
- Check Windows Event Viewer

### First Launch Issues

**"Taking a long time"**
- Normal! First launch takes 2-3 minutes
- Installing ~20 Python packages
- Subsequent launches are fast

**"Browser doesn't open"**
- Wait 10 seconds
- Manually open browser
- Go to: `http://localhost:8501`

**"Port 8501 already in use"**
- Another instance is running
- Close all browser tabs showing the app
- Close the black command window
- Try again

## 🔄 Updating the Application

### For Minor Changes (Code Only)

1. Update code files
2. Increment version in `installer.iss`
3. Run `build_installer.bat`
4. Distribute new installer

Users can install over existing installation.

### For Major Changes (Dependencies)

1. Update `requirements.txt`
2. Update version in `installer.iss`
3. Run `build_installer.bat`
4. Recommend users uninstall old version first

## 📏 File Sizes

| Component | Size |
|-----------|------|
| Installer (.exe) | ~500 KB |
| After installation | ~10 MB |
| After first launch | ~200 MB |
| (Python packages) | (~190 MB) |

**Note**: Large size is due to data science packages (pandas, numpy, plotly). This is normal for Python data applications.
