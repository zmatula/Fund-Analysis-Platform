## Key Formulas Reference

### Holding Period Calculation

```
days = 365 × ln(MOIC) / ln(1 + IRR)
```

**Example:**
```
MOIC = 2.0, IRR = 0.25
days = 365 × ln(2.0) / ln(1.25)
     = 365 × 0.6931 / 0.2231
     = 1,134 days
```

### IRR Calculation (Newton-Raphson)

```
NPV(r) = -Initial_Investment + Σ(CF_i / (1 + r)^(days_i/365))

dNPV/dr = -Σ(years_i × CF_i / (1 + r)^(years_i + 1))

r_new = r_old - NPV(r_old) / (dNPV/dr)(r_old)
```

**Convergence:**
- Initial guess: r = 0.1 (10%)
- Max iterations: 100
- Tolerance: 1e-6
- Bounds: [-0.9999, 10.0]

### Financial Engineering

**Leverage:**
```
Leverage Amount = Total Invested × Leverage Rate
Total Capital = Total Invested + Leverage Amount
```

**Management Fees:**
```
Management Fees = Total Capital × Fee Rate × Years Held
```

**Carry:**
```
Hurdle Return = Total Capital × (1 + Hurdle Rate × Years Held)
Excess Return = max(0, Total Returned - Hurdle Return)
Carry Paid = Excess Return × Carry Rate
```

**Net Returns:**
```
Net Returned = Total Returned - Leverage Cost - Management Fees - Carry Paid
Net Profit = Net Returned - Total Invested
Net MOIC = Net Returned / Total Invested
```

## Critical Implementation Details

### 1. Random Number Generation

**MUST USE:**
```python
import numpy as np
random_state = np.random.RandomState(seed=42)
```

**Why:**
- Ensures reproducibility
- Same inputs → identical outputs
- Enables testing and debugging

### 2. Investment Selection

**MUST USE REPLACEMENT:**
```python
indices = random_state.choice(len(investments), size=count, replace=True)
```

**Why:**
- Models concentration risk
- Same investment can appear multiple times
- More realistic for venture portfolios

### 3. Cash Flow Aggregation

**MUST AGGREGATE BY DAY:**
```python
if exit_day in cash_flows:
    cash_flows[exit_day] += exit_amount
else:
    cash_flows[exit_day] = exit_amount
```

**Why:**
- Reduces dictionary size
- Improves IRR calculation performance
- Matches real-world fund mechanics

### 4. Financial Engineering Sequence

**MUST FOLLOW EXACT ORDER:**
1. Calculate total capital (with leverage)
2. Calculate gross returns
3. Calculate leverage cost
4. Calculate management fees
5. Calculate hurdle return
6. Calculate excess return
7. Calculate carry
8. Calculate net returns

**Why:**
- Carry depends on hurdle
- Hurdle depends on total capital
- Fees depend on time held
- Order matters for correctness

### 5. IRR Adjustment

**MUST ADJUST IRR = -1.0:**
```python
if irr == -1.0:
    irr = -0.9999
```

**Why:**
- Avoids log(0) in holding period calculation
- Mathematical singularity
- Small adjustment doesn't affect results significantly

---

## Validation Criteria

### Mathematical Correctness

✅ **Holding Period:**
- MOIC=2.0, IRR=0.25 → 1,134 days ± 10
- MOIC=3.0, IRR=0.45 → 892 days ± 10

✅ **IRR Calculation:**
- $1M invested, $1.5M after 2 years → 22.47% ± 0.5%
- Convergence within 100 iterations

✅ **Financial Engineering:**
- $10M invested, 50% leverage → $15M total capital
- $15M capital, 2% fee, 3.5 years → $1.05M fees
- $20M returned, $19.2M hurdle, 20% carry → $160K carry

### Reproducibility

✅ **Same Inputs → Same Outputs:**
- Run simulation twice with seed=42
- All results identical (MOIC, IRR, selections)

✅ **Hash Consistency:**
- Same data → same data_hash
- Same data + config → same total_hash

### Performance

✅ **Speed Requirements:**
- 1,000 simulations: < 10 seconds
- 10,000 simulations: < 120 seconds
- 100,000 simulations: < 15 minutes

### Statistical Validity

✅ **Distributions:**
- Mean ≈ expected value
- Std dev > 0
- 5th percentile < median < 95th percentile
- Histogram shows reasonable distribution

## Common Implementation Pitfalls

### ❌ Pitfall 1: Using Python's random module

**Wrong:**
```python
import random
random.seed(42)
size = round(random.gauss(mean, std_dev))
```

**Right:**
```python
import numpy as np
random_state = np.random.RandomState(seed=42)
size = round(random_state.normal(mean, std_dev))
```

### ❌ Pitfall 2: Selecting investments WITHOUT replacement

**Wrong:**
```python
selected = random.sample(investments, k=count)
```

**Right:**
```python
indices = random_state.choice(len(investments), size=count, replace=True)
selected = [investments[i] for i in indices]
```

### ❌ Pitfall 3: Wrong financial engineering order

**Wrong:**
```python
# Calculating carry before establishing hurdle
carry = (total_returned - total_capital) * carry_rate  # WRONG!
hurdle_return = total_capital * (1 + hurdle_rate * years)
```

**Right:**
```python
# Calculate hurdle FIRST, then carry
hurdle_return = total_capital * (1 + hurdle_rate * years)
excess = max(0, total_returned - hurdle_return)
carry = excess * carry_rate
```

### ❌ Pitfall 4: Incorrect MOIC basis

**Wrong:**
```python
net_moic = net_returned / total_capital  # Uses leveraged capital!
```

**Right:**
```python
net_moic = net_returned / total_invested  # Uses LP capital only
```

### ❌ Pitfall 5: Not handling edge cases

**Wrong:**
```python
days = 365 * math.log(moic) / math.log(1 + irr)  # Can crash!
```

**Right:**
```python
if moic <= 0:
    return 365
if irr == -1.0:
    irr = -0.9999
try:
    days = 365 * math.log(moic) / math.log(1 + irr)
    return max(1, round(days))
except:
    return 365
```
