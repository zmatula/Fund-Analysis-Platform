  - Default: 1,000

**Market Views:**
- **Return Outlook**:
  - Pessimistic = Historical - 10%
  - Base = Historical average
  - Optimistic = Historical + 10%
- **Volatility Confidence**:
  - Low = 1.5√ó historical volatility (more uncertainty)
  - Medium = 1.0√ó historical volatility
  - High = 0.5√ó historical volatility (more confident)

### 3. Run Simulation Tab

1. **Review summary**: Check simulation count and investment count
2. **Optional**: Check "Export detailed investment and cash flow data" for CSV export
3. **Click "‚ñ∂Ô∏è Run Simulation"**
4. **Wait for completion**: Progress bar shows 4 stages:
   - Stage 0: Beta Decomposition
   - Stage 1: Alpha Simulation
   - Stage 2: Beta Forward Simulation
   - Stage 3: Gross Reconstruction
   - Stage 4: Net Reconstruction

**Typical Runtime:**
- 1,000 simulations: ~5 seconds
- 10,000 simulations: ~30 seconds
- 100,000 simulations: ~5 minutes

### 4. Results Tab

#### Export Results to Excel

**Click "üì• Export Results to Excel"** at the top of the Results tab.

**Excel Report Contents:**
- **Executive Summary**: Fund info, parameters, key metrics
- **Alpha Returns (Stage 1)**: Statistics and distribution charts
- **Beta Simulation (Stage 2)**: Market projections and terminal values
- **Gross Performance (Stage 3)**: Total returns with beta attribution
- **Net Performance (Stage 4)**: Final returns after all costs

**File saved as**: `{FundName}_Results_{timestamp}.xlsx`

#### Histogram Settings

**Click "üìä Histogram Settings"** to customize charts:
- **Number of Bins**: 10-200 (default: 50)
  - More bins = more detail, less bins = smoother
- **Histogram Type**:
  - Frequency: Raw counts
  - Probability Density: Normalized distribution

**Note**: Settings apply to both on-screen charts AND Excel export.

#### Understanding Results

**Stage 1: Alpha (Excess Returns)**
- Returns above the market benchmark
- Shows manager skill independent of market performance

**Stage 2: Beta Forward Simulation**
- Future market projections
- Median path shows expected market trajectory
- 5th/95th percentiles show range of outcomes

**Stage 3: Gross Performance**
- Total returns = Alpha √ó Beta
- Before management fees and carry

**Stage 4: Net Performance**
- Final LP returns after:
  - Management fees (2% default)
  - Carried interest (20% default above 8% hurdle)
  - Leverage costs

## Troubleshooting

### Application won't start

**Check:**
1. Is Python installed? Open Command Prompt and type: `python --version`
   - Should show Python 3.8 or higher
   - If not, download from: https://www.python.org/downloads/
2. Is there an error message in the black window?
   - Take a screenshot and contact support

### Browser doesn't open automatically

1. Wait 10 seconds for app to start
2. Manually open browser and go to: `http://localhost:8501`

### "Beta price data is required" error

**Solution:** You must upload beta prices in the Data Import tab before running simulation.

### CSV import errors

**Common issues:**
- Extra headers in CSV ‚Üí Remove first row
- Wrong number of columns ‚Üí Check you have exactly 5 columns for investments, 2 for beta
- Invalid dates ‚Üí Use format YYYY-MM-DD
- IRR as percentage (25%) ‚Üí Use decimal (0.25)

### Simulation takes too long

**Solutions:**
- Reduce number of simulations (try 1,000 for testing)
- Reduce number of beta paths (try 500)
- Close other programs to free up memory

### Excel export fails

**Check:**
1. Do you have Excel installed? (not required, but helps)
2. Is there a "Missing dependencies" error?
   - Open Command Prompt
   - Type: `cd "C:\Program Files\Monte Carlo Fund Simulation"`
   - Type: `venv\Scripts\pip install openpyxl kaleido`

## Tips & Best Practices

### Data Preparation

‚úÖ **DO:**
- Use monthly beta data (easier to obtain than daily)
- Ensure beta data covers full investment period
- Use consistent date formats
- Remove any totals/summary rows from CSVs

‚ùå **DON'T:**
- Mix different benchmarks in beta data
- Include header rows in CSVs
- Use IRR as percentages (use decimals: 0.25 not 25%)

### Simulation Setup

**For initial testing:**
- 1,000-5,000 simulations
- 500-1,000 beta paths
- Base outlook, Medium confidence

**For final analysis:**
- 10,000-50,000 simulations
- 1,000-2,000 beta paths
- Adjust outlook/confidence based on market view

### Interpreting Results

**Focus on medians, not means:**
- Medians are more robust to outliers
- More representative of "typical" outcome

**Use percentiles for risk assessment:**
- 5th percentile = downside scenario
- Median = expected scenario
- 95th percentile = upside scenario

**Compare stages:**
- Alpha shows manager value-add
- Gross shows total value creation
- Net shows investor returns

### Common Questions

**Q: Can I save my configuration?**
A: Not currently. You'll need to re-enter parameters each session.

**Q: Can I export raw simulation data?**
A: Yes! Check "Export detailed data" in Run Simulation tab, then use the CSV export buttons in Results.

**Q: How do I stop the application?**
A: Close the black command window, or press Ctrl+C in it.

**Q: Can I run multiple simulations?**
A: Yes! Run a simulation, export results, then change parameters and run again.

**Q: Is my data saved?**
A: No, the app doesn't store data. Always export your results to Excel.
